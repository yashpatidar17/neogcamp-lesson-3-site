            <h1>What is Pixels ?
            </h1>
            <small>December 9th 2023</small>
            <p>A pixel is a single group of coloured dots (normally red, green and blue) on a screen. By turning them on and off at different intensities, any number of colours and brightness can be created. The colour black is created when all the dots are off, and white is created when red, green and blue are all on at the same time. In short, they are the physical lights on a screen that allow you to see what’s being displayed where each one is so small you can’t individually identify them without looking very closely.</p>
            <h2>DPI</h2>
            <p>DPI is also often referred to as PPI (pixels per inch) and is calculated by dividing the number of pixels across or down a screen by the width or height in inches. A higher DPI means each individual pixel must be smaller and smaller in order to be able to fit into the available space, meaning the clearer the screen will be and the higher the level of detail that screen can draw.
